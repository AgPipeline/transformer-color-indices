## Overview
The Greenness Transformer is meant to provide several calculations on image rgb data in order to get an idea of plant growth and
health. A more in-depth explanation can be found at [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cAm5w1Bs6dB1SHgf-HVmwwbebLhbZMUvTkXLtas_-xI/edit)

## Algorithm Description
This transformer provides calculations using the red, green, and blue values for pixels in an image ranging from calculating the
percentage of an image which is green to normalized difference calculations and more
